Innovation Explosion 

Think Like a StartUP

prepare to fail in a startup founder.

Stand Out(little chance to success)

Have a similar idea like anyone else,stop and think again.

We dont need a big idea, we need a idea lead to bug one.

where you go is important than where you start.

Think Small

an example: family video（this is the start point）

bad idea with great team || good idea with bad team  => the Team Matter => Small Team move quickly

Engage your Team:

Small Scope:
ins started with a huge plan,but it rolls slow,and they found user use ins to do 2 things: take photo and share to facebook, make up the picture. so they cut all the other plan into a small scope.

Small Budgets:
money is good for make it large, invest is good when you're small and a little money.

Small Time:

Challenge Your Beliefs:

Think Deeply:
 	turn off your phone and sit down to think deeply in 2 hours weekly.(think about life and business)

Get Dirty:

Shut UP & Observe:
jump deep into where you are interested in and observe what they do and try to find out the drawback.

Use New Technology:

Run Experiments:

Watch What Happen：

Don't Chase Losers：

One Big Success:

----


Ask what we should do to get a high point.
